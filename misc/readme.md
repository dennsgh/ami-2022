# Miscellaneous 

In this folder we stored all other files we worked on during the project as requested in the project description

**presentations** contains our Pecha-Kuchas

**video** contains our video script

**wiki** contains our exported Confluence Wiki with meeting notes, guidelines, research results and internal how-tos

We all worked on these documents and stored them in our Sharepoint and Confluence Page. As it is simpler only one group member uploaded these documents. This explicitly doesn't diminish the work of all other group members.
